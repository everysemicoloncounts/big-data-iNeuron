### 1. MySQL Table (Table should have some column like created_at or updated_at so that can be used for incremental read)

To create a MySQL table with columns for created_at and updated_at timestamps, you can use the following SQL statement:

```
CREATE TABLE your_table_name (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    column1 datatype1,
    column2 datatype2,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

```
In this example, replace your_table_name with the desired name for your table. You can also customize the column names (column1, column2, etc.) and datatypes (datatype1, datatype2, etc.) according to your specific requirements.

The created_at column is set to the current timestamp when a new row is inserted, while the updated_at column is automatically updated to the current timestamp whenever a row is modified.

Including these timestamp columns allows you to track the creation and modification times of your data, enabling incremental read operations based on these timestamps.

### 2. Write a python script which is running in infinite loop and inserting 4-5 dummy/dynamically prepared records
    in MySQL Table

```
import random
import string
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error

def generate_dummy_data():
    # Generate random data for the dummy records
    letters = string.ascii_lowercase
    random_string = ''.join(random.choice(letters) for _ in range(5))
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    return random_string, random_number

def insert_dummy_records():
    try:
        # Connect to MySQL database
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='your_host',
            database='your_database',
            user='your_user',
            password='your_password'
        )

        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor = connection.cursor()

            # Generate and insert dummy records
            for _ in range(4, 6):
                data = generate_dummy_data()
                query = "INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)"
                cursor.execute(query, data)
                connection.commit()

            print("Dummy records inserted successfully!")

    except Error as e:
        print("Error:", e)

    finally:
        # Close database connection
        if connection.is_connected():
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()

# Run the script in an infinite loop
while True:
    insert_dummy_records()

```

Make sure to replace the following placeholders with your own MySQL database connection details:

    your_host: the host address of your MySQL server (e.g., 'localhost')
    your_database: the name of your MySQL database
    your_user: the username to connect to the database
    your_password: the password for the specified user
    your_table_name: the name of the table where you want to insert the dummy records

The script generates random data for the dummy records and inserts them into the specified table using parameterized queries. It continuously runs in an infinite loop, inserting 4-5 new dummy records in each iteration.

### 3. Setup Confluent Kafka

Download Confluent Platform: Visit the Confluent website at https://www.confluent.io/download to download the Confluent Platform distribution that matches your operating system.

Extract the files: Extract the downloaded Confluent Platform files to a directory of your choice.

Start ZooKeeper: Kafka uses ZooKeeper for coordination. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the Confluent Platform directory, and start ZooKeeper using the following command:
```
./bin/zookeeper-server-start ./etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties

```

Start Kafka brokers: Open a new terminal or command prompt window and start one or more Kafka brokers by running the following command:
```
./bin/kafka-server-start ./etc/kafka/server.properties

```

Create Kafka topics: You can create Kafka topics using the following command:
```
./bin/kafka-topics --create --topic your_topic_name --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

```
Replace your_topic_name with the desired name of your Kafka topic.

Produce and consume messages: Start a producer to send messages to your Kafka topic by running the following command:
```
./bin/kafka-console-producer --topic your_topic_name --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

```

Start a consumer to receive messages from your Kafka topic by running the following command in a separate terminal or command prompt window:
```
./bin/kafka-console-consumer --topic your_topic_name --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning

```
Replace your_topic_name with the name of your Kafka topic.

These steps provide a basic setup of Confluent Kafka, including starting ZooKeeper, Kafka brokers, creating a topic, and producing/consuming messages. You can further customize the configuration and explore more advanced features of Kafka based on your requirements. Refer to the Confluent documentation for more detailed information and additional configuration options.

### 4. Create Topic

To create a topic in Confluent Kafka, you can use the kafka-topics command-line tool. Here's an example command to create a topic:

```
./bin/kafka-topics --create --topic your_topic_name --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

```
Here's a breakdown of the command and its options:

    ./bin/kafka-topics: This is the command to execute the kafka-topics tool.
    --create: This option specifies that you want to create a new topic.
    --topic your_topic_name: Replace your_topic_name with the desired name for your topic.
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092: This option specifies the Kafka bootstrap server(s) to connect to. Adjust the value if your Kafka broker is running on a different host or port.
    --partitions 1: This option specifies the number of partitions for the topic. Adjust the value according to your requirements.
    --replication-factor 1: This option specifies the replication factor for the topic. Adjust the value based on the number of Kafka brokers in your cluster.

After running the command, Kafka will create the topic with the specified settings. You can then use the created topic for producing and consuming messages.

### 5. Create json schema on schema registry (depends on what kind of data you are publishing in mysql table)

```
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "YourRecordName",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "int"},
    {"name": "column1", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "column2", "type": "int"},
    {"name": "created_at", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "updated_at", "type": "string"}
  ]
}

```
In this example, you need to replace "YourRecordName" with the desired name for your record.

The schema defines a JSON object with fields corresponding to the columns in your MySQL table. Each field has a "name" representing the column name and a "type" indicating the data type of the column.

To register the JSON schema on the Schema Registry, you can use the Confluent's kafka-avro-console-producer tool with the --schema-registry option. Here's an example command:

./bin/kafka-avro-console-producer --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic your_topic_name --property value.schema='{"type":"record","name":"YourRecordName","fields":[{"name":"id","type":"int"},{"name":"column1","type":"string"},{"name":"column2","type":"int"},{"name":"created_at","type":"string"},{"name":"updated_at","type":"string"}]}'

Replace localhost:9092 with the address and port of your Kafka broker, and your_topic_name with the name of your Kafka topic.

The value.schema property in the command specifies the JSON schema for the messages being produced. Use the JSON schema defined earlier for the value of this property.

By running the command, the JSON schema will be registered on the Schema Registry, and subsequent messages produced with this schema will be validated against it.

### 6. Write a producer code which will read the data from MySQL table incrementally (hint : use and maintain create_at column)
```
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

def connect_to_mysql():
    try:
        # Connect to MySQL database
        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
            host='your_host',
            database='your_database',
            user='your_user',
            password='your_password'
        )
        return connection

    except Error as e:
        print("Error:", e)
        return None

def retrieve_incremental_data(connection, last_timestamp):
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        # Retrieve data from MySQL table incrementally based on created_at column
        query = "SELECT * FROM your_table_name WHERE created_at > %s"
        cursor.execute(query, (last_timestamp,))
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        return result

    except Error as e:
        print("Error:", e)
        return None

def produce_to_kafka(data):
    # Kafka producer configuration
    producer = KafkaProducer(
        bootstrap_servers='your_bootstrap_servers',
        value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
    )

    # Produce data to Kafka topic
    for row in data:
        message = {
            'id': row[0],
            'column1': row[1],
            'column2': row[2],
            'created_at': row[3],
            'updated_at': row[4]
        }
        producer.send('your_topic_name', value=message)

    producer.flush()

# Connect to MySQL database
mysql_connection = connect_to_mysql()

# Initialize the last_timestamp as the starting point for incremental read
last_timestamp = '1970-01-01 00:00:00'

while True:
    # Retrieve incremental data from MySQL
    incremental_data = retrieve_incremental_data(mysql_connection, last_timestamp)

    if incremental_data:
        # Produce data to Kafka
        produce_to_kafka(incremental_data)

        # Update the last_timestamp to the latest value
        last_timestamp = incremental_data[-1][3]

    # Delay between iterations
    # Adjust the delay according to your needs
    time.sleep(60)  # Delay for 60 seconds

```

In this code:

    Replace the placeholders:
        your_host: the host address of your MySQL server
        your_database: the name of your MySQL database
        your_user: the username to connect to the database
        your_password: the password for the specified user
        your_bootstrap_servers: the bootstrap servers of your Kafka cluster
        your_table_name: the name of the MySQL table you created
        your_topic_name: the name of the Kafka topic you want to produce to

    The connect_to_mysql() function establishes a connection to the MySQL database.

    The retrieve_incremental_data() function retrieves incremental data from the MySQL table based on the created_at column. It takes the MySQL connection and the last timestamp as input and returns the retrieved data.

    The produce_to_kafka() function configures the Kafka producer and sends each row of data as a JSON message to the Kafka topic.

    The script continuously retrieves incremental data from MySQL, produces it to the Kafka topic, and updates the last_timestamp variable with the latest timestamp from the retrieved data.

    The loop pauses for a specified duration (in this case, 60 seconds) before the next iteration.

### 7. Producer will publish data in Kafka Topic
### 8. Write consumer group to consume data from Kafka topic

```
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

# Kafka consumer configuration
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'your_topic_name',
    bootstrap_servers='your_bootstrap_servers',
    group_id='your_consumer_group_id',
    value_deserializer=lambda x: json.loads(x.decode('utf-8'))
)

# Consume messages from the Kafka topic
for message in consumer:
    data = message.value
    # Process the consumed data as needed
    print(data)

```
Make sure to replace the placeholders in the code:

    your_topic_name: the name of the Kafka topic from which you want to consume data.
    your_bootstrap_servers: the bootstrap servers of your Kafka cluster.
    your_consumer_group_id: a unique identifier for your consumer group.

The consumer is configured to subscribe to the specified topic, connecting to the Kafka cluster using the provided bootstrap servers. It uses the consumer group ID to identify itself as part of a consumer group.

The code enters a loop and consumes messages from the Kafka topic. Each message is deserialized as JSON, and you can process the consumed data as needed. In this example, the code simply prints the consumed data, but you can modify it to perform any required processing or actions.

### 9. In Kafka consumer code do some changes or transformation for each record and write it in Cassandra table

```
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

# Kafka consumer configuration
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'your_topic_name',
    bootstrap_servers='your_bootstrap_servers',
    group_id='your_consumer_group_id',
    value_deserializer=lambda x: json.loads(x.decode('utf-8'))
)

# Cassandra connection
cluster = Cluster(['your_cassandra_host'])
session = cluster.connect('your_cassandra_keyspace')

# Consume messages from the Kafka topic
for message in consumer:
    data = message.value
    
    # Apply transformations to the consumed data
    transformed_data = transform_data(data)
    
    # Write the transformed data to Cassandra table
    insert_data_to_cassandra(transformed_data)

# Close the Cassandra session and cluster
session.shutdown()
cluster.shutdown()

```
Make sure to replace the placeholders in the code:

    your_topic_name: the name of the Kafka topic from which you want to consume data.
    your_bootstrap_servers: the bootstrap servers of your Kafka cluster.
    your_consumer_group_id: a unique identifier for your consumer group.
    your_cassandra_host: the host address of your Cassandra cluster.
    your_cassandra_keyspace: the name of the Cassandra keyspace where you want to write the data.

In this code, after consuming a message from the Kafka topic, it applies the desired transformations to the consumed data using the transform_data() function. Modify this function according to your specific transformation logic.

Then, it writes the transformed data to a Cassandra table using the insert_data_to_cassandra() function. Implement this function to perform the necessary insert operation into the Cassandra table. You'll need to use the cassandra-driver library to execute the INSERT statement.

Finally, the Cassandra session and cluster are closed to clean up resources.
