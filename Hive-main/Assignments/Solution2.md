# Scenario Based questions:

`1. Will the reducer work or not if you use “Limit 1” in any HiveQL query?`

Yes, the reducer will work even if you use "limit 1" in the hiveql query.

The "limit" clause in a hiveql query limits the number of rows returned by the query. This does not affect the number of mappers or reducers used by the hive runtime.

Reducers are responsible for aggregating the results generated by mappers. It works on the intermediate key-value pairs generated by the mapper, and it doesn't matter if it reduces a single row or a million rows.
So even if you use "limit 1" in your hiveql query, the reducer will still work and produce the final output. However, since the query is limited to one line, the reducer will only have one output.

`2. Suppose I have installed Apache Hive on top of my Hadoop cluster using default metastore configuration. Then, what will happen if we have multiple clients trying to access Hive at the same time?`

If you installed Apache Hive on a Hadoop cluster with the default metastore configuration and multiple clients attempt to access Hive simultaneously, those clients will be able to access the metastore simultaneously, but some performance issues may occur.

The default metastore configuration in Hive was a local Derby database, which was not designed to handle concurrent access from multiple clients. When multiple clients attempt to access the metastore simultaneously, they may experience delays or errors due to contention for database resources.

To improve performance and allow concurrent access to the metastore, you can use an external database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) as the metastore instead of the default Derby database. External databases can handle multiple client connections and provide better performance and scalability.
In addition to using an external database, you can also use ZooKeeper to configure Hive to use a distributed metastore, which allows multiple instances of Hive to share the same metastore and provides high availability and scalability.

`3. Suppose, I create a table that contains details of all the transactions done by the customers: CREATE TABLE transaction_details (cust_id INT, amount FLOAT, month STRING, country STRING) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ;
Now, after inserting 50,000 records in this table, I want to know the total revenue generated for each month. But, Hive is taking too much time in processing this query. How will you solve this problem and list the steps that I will be taking in order to do so?`

To solve the problem of slow query processing in Hive for calculating total revenue generated for each month from the "transaction_details" table with 50,000 records, the following steps can be taken:

    1. Partition the table: Partitioning the table by the "month" column can significantly speed up the query processing. This can be done using the following command:
    ```
    ALTER TABLE transaction_details ADD PARTITION (month='Jan') LOCATION '/path/to/Jan';

    ```
    The above command creates a partition for the "Jan" month and specifies the location where the data for that partition will be stored.
    Repeat this command for all the other months in the table.

    2. Use the partitioned column in the query: Modify the query to use the partitioned column in the WHERE clause to filter the data for each month. This will limit the amount of data that needs to be processed by the query.
    ```
    SELECT month, SUM(amount) as total_revenue 
    FROM transaction_details 
    WHERE month='Jan'
    GROUP BY month;

    ```
    Repeat the above query for all the other months in the table.

    3. Use bucketing: Bucketing can also help in improving query performance by dividing data into smaller and more manageable chunks. However, in this case, since the table has only 50,000 records, partitioning should be sufficient.

    4. Optimize query configuration: If the above steps don't improve the query performance, then you can try optimizing the query configuration parameters such as the number of reducers and the memory allocation for each task.
    For example, you can increase the number of reducers to distribute the processing workload across multiple nodes, or increase the memory allocation for each task to avoid out-of-memory errors.

By following the above steps, the query processing time can be significantly reduced, and you can get the total revenue generated for each month from the "transaction_details" table more efficiently.


`4. How can you add a new partition for the month December in the above partitioned table?`

`5. I am inserting data into a table based on partitions dynamically. But, I received an error – FAILED ERROR IN SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: Dynamic partition strict mode requires at least one static partition column. How will you remove this error?`

`6. Suppose, I have a CSV file – "sample.csv" present in "/temp" directory with the following entries\-
id first_name last_name email gender ip_address
How will you consume this CSV file into the Hive warehouse using built-in SerDe?`


`7. Suppose, I have a lot of small CSV files present in the input directory in HDFS and I want to create a single Hive table corresponding to these files. The data in these files are in the format: {id, name, e-mail, country}. Now, as we know, Hadoop performance degrades when we use lots of small files.
So, how will you solve this problem where we want to create a single Hive table for lots of small files without degrading the performance of the system?`

`8. LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH ‘Home/country/state/’
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE address;
The following statement failed to execute. What can be the cause?`

`9. Is it possible to add 100 nodes when we already have 100 nodes in Hive? If yes, how?`
