### 1. What is the definition of Hive? What is the present version of Hive?

A software system or framework that provides tools and services for building and deploying applications, often used in big data processing and analytics.

As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the current version of Apache Hive, an open-source data warehousing and SQL query engine for Hadoop, was version 4.0.0. However, it's worth noting that new versions of software are regularly released, so the version number may have changed since then.

Also, there are multiple distributions of Hive maintained by different vendors, such as Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR, which may have different version numbers and release schedules.

### 2. Is Hive suitable to be used for OLTP systems? Why?

No, Hive is generally not suitable for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems because it is optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads, which involve querying and analyzing large volumes of data, rather than real-time transaction processing.
Hive is designed to work with Hadoop, a distributed computing platform that is well-suited for batch processing and handling large-scale data analytics workloads. It uses a query language called HiveQL, which is similar to SQL but optimized for processing data in Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS).
OLTP systems, on the other hand, are typically used to manage and process online transactions in real-time, such as credit card payments, inventory management, and order processing. They require low-latency, high-concurrency processing, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which Hive is not optimized for.
In summary, while Hive is a powerful tool for batch processing and data warehousing, it is not the best choice for OLTP systems that require real-time transaction processing and high-concurrency support.

### 3. How is HIVE different from RDBMS? Does hive support ACID transactions? If not then give the proper reason
Hive is different from traditional RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems) in several ways:
Data model: RDBMS uses a structured data model with fixed schema and predefined relationships between tables, while Hive uses a semi-structured or unstructured data model, allowing for more flexibility in handling large volumes of data.
Processing paradigm: RDBMS supports real-time transaction processing (OLTP) using row-level locking, whereas Hive is optimized for batch processing and data warehousing using a MapReduce or Tez execution engine.
SQL support: Both RDBMS and Hive support SQL, but the SQL dialects are different, and Hive has limitations compared to traditional RDBMS, such as limited support for subqueries and constraints.
Regarding ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, Hive does not support them in the traditional sense because it is designed for batch processing, not real-time transaction processing. However, it does support ACID-like features, such as the ability to write data to HDFS in a transactional manner using the Apache ORC file format, and the ability to roll back incomplete transactions.
The reason why Hive doesn't support traditional ACID transactions is that implementing them would require significant changes to the underlying Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS), which is designed for scalability and fault-tolerance, not transactional consistency. Hadoop uses a write-once, read-many architectures, which makes it challenging to support real-time updates and deletes without compromising performance and scalability.

### 4. Explain the hive architecture and the different components of a Hive architecture?
Hive is a data warehousing and SQL query engine that runs on top of Hadoop, a distributed computing platform. Its architecture consists of several components that work together to process data and execute queries:
Hive Metastore - The Metastore is a central repository that stores metadata about the data stored in Hive, such as table schemas, partitions, and storage locations. It uses a relational database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Derby to store metadata.
Hive Query Language (HiveQL) - HiveQL is a SQL-like language that allows users to interact with data stored in Hadoop. It is translated into MapReduce or Tez jobs by the Hive engine and executed on Hadoop clusters.
Hive Execution Engine - The execution engine is responsible for processing queries and converting them into a series of MapReduce or Tez jobs that are executed on Hadoop. It consists of two main components:
Compiler: The compiler analyzes queries and generates a logical execution plan, which is then translated into a physical execution plan that can be executed on Hadoop.
Execution: The execution component executes the physical plan and manages tasks such as input/output, serialization, and deserialization.
Hive Server - The Hive Server is a service that provides a Thrift interface for clients to submit queries and interact with the Hive engine. It supports multiple client connections and can run in various modes, such as HTTP, JDBC, or ODBC.
Hive Drivers - Hive Drivers are libraries or connectors that enable users to interact with the Hive Server and execute queries from different programming languages, such as Java, Python, or R.
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) - HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hive to store data. It is a distributed file system that can scale to handle petabytes of data and provides fault-tolerance and high availability.
Overall, the Hive architecture is designed to handle large-scale data warehousing and processing workloads by leveraging the scalability and fault-tolerance of Hadoop.

### 5. Mention what Hive query processor does? And Mention what are the components of a Hive query processor?
The Hive query processor is responsible for processing and executing queries submitted to the Hive engine. It consists of several components that work together to translate HiveQL queries into a series of MapReduce or Tez jobs that can be executed on Hadoop:
Parser - The parser is the first component of the query processor and is responsible for parsing the HiveQL query and creating a logical plan that represents the query's structure.
Semantic Analyzer - The semantic analyzer takes the logical plan generated by the parser and applies semantic analysis to it, which involves resolving references to tables and columns, validating the query's syntax and semantics, and optimizing the query for execution.
Query Optimizer - The query optimizer takes the logical plan generated by the semantic analyzer and applies various optimization techniques to improve query performance. These techniques include pruning unnecessary columns, reducing the number of map/reduce jobs required, and optimizing join operations.
Physical Plan Generator - The physical plan generator takes the optimized logical plan and generates a physical execution plan that can be executed on Hadoop. This plan includes the order of MapReduce or Tez jobs, data distribution, and data serialization and deserialization.
Execution Engine - The execution engine is responsible for executing the physical execution plan generated by the physical plan generator. It includes several sub-components, such as input/output processing, serialization/deserialization, and task scheduling.
Overall, the Hive query processor is a complex system that translates queries into a series of MapReduce or Tez jobs and optimizes them for performance. It leverages the scalability and fault-tolerance of Hadoop to handle large-scale data warehousing and processing workloads.

### 6. What are the three different modes in which we can operate Hive?
Hive can be operated in three different modes:
Local Mode - In Local mode, Hive runs in a single JVM and uses the local file system instead of HDFS. This mode is mainly used for development and testing purposes.
MapReduce Mode - In MapReduce mode, Hive runs on top of Hadoop's MapReduce framework and uses HDFS as its primary storage system. This mode is suitable for large-scale data warehousing and processing workloads.
Spark Mode - In Spark mode, Hive runs on top of Apache Spark and uses Spark's distributed computing engine to execute queries. This mode provides faster query processing performance compared to MapReduce mode but may require additional setup and configuration.
Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of mode depends on the specific use case and requirements of the user. For example, Local mode may be suitable for small-scale data processing and quick data exploration, while MapReduce or Spark mode may be suitable for large-scale data processing and analysis.

### 7. Features and Limitations of Hive.
Hive is a popular SQL-like query engine that runs on top of Hadoop and provides a high-level interface for data warehousing and processing. Some of its key features include:
Features:
SQL-Like Language - Hive supports a SQL-like language called HiveQL, which allows users to interact with data using familiar SQL syntax.
Scalability - Hive can handle large-scale data processing workloads by leveraging the scalability of Hadoop.
Extensibility - Hive is highly extensible and can be extended through the use of custom user-defined functions (UDFs) and SerDes (Serialization/Deserialization) to support different data formats.
Data Warehousing - Hive supports data warehousing features such as partitioning, bucketing, and indexing to improve query performance and data organization.
Integration with Hadoop Ecosystem - Hive integrates with other Hadoop ecosystem components such as HBase, Pig, and Spark to provide a complete data processing and analysis platform.
Security - Hive provides security features such as authentication and authorization to control access to data and ensure data privacy.
However, Hive also has some limitations:
Limitations:
Latency - Hive's query processing can have high latency due to its reliance on MapReduce or Tez jobs for query execution.
Limited Support for Real-Time Processing - Hive is not designed for real-time processing and is more suited for batch processing workloads.
Limited ACID Transactions - Hive does not support full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which can limit its suitability for OLTP workloads.
Performance - While Hive provides scalable processing, it may not always provide the same level of performance as traditional RDBMS systems for certain types of queries or workloads.
Overall, Hive provides a powerful and flexible data warehousing and processing platform, but its suitability depends on the specific use case and requirements of the user.

### 8. How to create a Database in HIVE?
To create a database in Hive, you can use the following syntax:
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
Here, database_name is the name of the database you want to create.
For example, to create a database named ‘mydatabase’, you would use the following command:
```
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;

```
After running this command, Hive will create a new database with the specified name in the default location in HDFS.
You can also specify the location for the database by using the ‘LOCATION’ keyword in the ‘CREATE DATABASE’ statement. For example:
```
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase

```
LOCATION '/my/custom/location/';

This will create a new database named ‘mydatabase’ in the specified location in HDFS instead of the default location.
Once you have created a database, you can use the ‘USE’ statement to switch to the newly created database and start creating tables and querying data within it. For example:
USE mydatabase;
This will set the mydatabase as the active database in Hive, and any subsequent queries or operations will be performed within this database.

### 9. How to create a table in HIVE?
To create a table in Hive, you can use the following syntax:
```
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1_name column1_datatype,
    column2_name column2_datatype,
    ...
)

```
Here, table_name is the name of the table you want to create, and column_name and column_datatype represent the name and datatype of each column in the table.
For example, to create a table named employees with columns id, name, age, and salary, you would use the following command:
```
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT,
    salary FLOAT
);

```
After running this command, Hive will create a new table named ‘employees’ with the specified columns. By default, Hive creates the table in the default database, but you can specify a different database by prefixing the table name with the database name, like ‘database_name.table_name’.
You can also specify additional properties for the table, such as partitioning, bucketing, and storage format. For example:

```
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT,
    salary FLOAT
)
PARTITIONED BY (department STRING)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC;

```
This creates a table named employees with an additional partition column named department, clustered by the id column into 4 buckets, and stored using the ORC file format.
Once you have created a table, you can start inserting data into it using the INSERT INTO statement or by loading data from an external file using the LOAD DATA statement.

### 10. What do you mean by describe and describe extended and describe formatted with respect to database and table
In Hive, `DESCRIBE` is a command used to display the metadata information about a table or database. The `DESCRIBE` command has three variations:

1. `DESCRIBE database_name`: This command is used to display the metadata information about a database. When executed, this command will display the list of tables in the specified database.

2. `DESCRIBE table_name`: This command is used to display the metadata information about a table. When executed, this command will display the list of columns in the specified table along with their data types.

3. `DESCRIBE FORMATTED|EXTENDED table_name`: This command is used to display the detailed metadata information about a table. When executed with the `FORMATTED` or `EXTENDED` keyword, this command will display additional information about the table, such as the table properties, storage information, column statistics, and more.

The `DESCRIBE FORMATTED` command displays the table metadata in a formatted way that is easy to read. It provides additional information such as the table location, input format, output format, serialization format, and more.

The `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` command provides even more detailed information about the table, including information about its partitions, storage properties, and serialization information.

Overall, the `DESCRIBE` command is a useful tool for understanding the metadata information about tables and databases in Hive. It can be used to quickly view the schema of a table or to get a more detailed understanding of its properties and characteristics.

### 11. How to skip header rows from a table in Hive?
To skip header rows from a table in Hive, you can use the `TBLPROPERTIES` clause while creating the table, and specify the number of rows to be skipped as a header. For example, if your table has a header row that you want to skip, you can create the table with the following command:
```
CREATE TABLE mytable (
  column1 string,
  column2 int,
  column3 float
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
TBLPROPERTIES ('skip.header.line.count'='1');
```

Here, `TBLPROPERTIES` is used to set a property called `skip.header.line.count` to a value of `1`. This will tell Hive to skip the first row of the input data when querying the table.

Note that the exact syntax for skipping header rows may depend on the format of your input data. In the example above, we assumed that the input data is in a text file format with fields separated by commas, but other formats may have different options for skipping headers.

### 12. What is a hive operator? What are the different types of hive operators?
In Hive, operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform various operations on data. There are several types of operators in Hive, including:

1. Arithmetic operators: These operators are used to perform mathematical calculations on numeric data. Examples include `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulus), and `^` (exponentiation).

2. Comparison operators: These operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result. Examples include `=` (equal to), `<>` or `!=` (not equal to), `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), and `<=` (less than or equal to).

3. Logical operators: These operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values. Examples include `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.

4. Bitwise operators: These operators are used to perform bitwise operations on binary values. Examples include `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (left shift), and `>>` (right shift).

5. Unary operators: These operators are used to perform operations on a single value. Examples include `+` (unary plus), `-` (unary minus), and `NOT` (logical NOT).

In addition to these basic operators, Hive also supports a number of built-in functions and UDFs (user-defined functions) that can be used to manipulate and analyze data.

Overall, operators are a critical part of the Hive query language and are used extensively in Hive queries to perform a wide range of data processing tasks.

### 13. Explain about the Hive Built-In Functions
Hive provides a wide range of built-in functions that can be used to perform various data manipulation and analysis tasks. These functions can be categorized into several types:

1. Mathematical functions: These functions are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data. Examples include `ABS()` (returns the absolute value of a number), `ROUND()` (rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places), `CEIL()` (returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number), and `FLOOR()` (returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number).

2. String functions: These functions are used to manipulate strings. Examples include `LENGTH()` (returns the length of a string), `SUBSTR()` (returns a substring of a string), `CONCAT()` (concatenates two or more strings), and `LOWER()` (converts a string to lowercase).

3. Date/time functions: These functions are used to manipulate dates and times. Examples include `YEAR()` (returns the year of a date), `MONTH()` (returns the month of a date), `DAY()` (returns the day of a date), `HOUR()` (returns the hour of a timestamp), and `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()` (converts a date/time string to a Unix timestamp).

4. Conditional functions: These functions are used to perform conditional operations. Examples include `IF()` (returns one value if a condition is true and another value if it is false), `CASE()` (evaluates a series of conditions and returns a value based on the first condition that is true), and `COALESCE()` (returns the first non-null value from a list of values).

5. Aggregate functions: These functions are used to perform aggregate operations on groups of data. Examples include `SUM()` (returns the sum of a set of values), `AVG()` (returns the average of a set of values), `MAX()` (returns the maximum value in a set of values), and `MIN()` (returns the minimum value in a set of values).

6. Collection functions: These functions are used to manipulate arrays and maps. Examples include `ARRAY()` (creates an array from a list of values), `MAP()` (creates a map from a list of key-value pairs), `SIZE()` (returns the size of an array or map), and `EXPLODE()` (returns a new row for each element in an array or map).

These are just a few examples of the many built-in functions available in Hive. By using these functions in Hive queries, users can perform a wide range of data manipulation and analysis tasks with ease.

### 14. Write hive DDL and DML commands
Hive supports a variety of Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands. Here are some examples of commonly used commands:

DDL Commands:
- `CREATE DATABASE`: creates a new database in Hive.
- `USE`: selects a specific database for use in subsequent commands.
- `CREATE TABLE`: creates a new table in Hive.
- `ALTER TABLE`: modifies the structure of an existing table.
- `DROP TABLE`: deletes an existing table.
- `SHOW DATABASES`: displays a list of all databases in Hive.
- `SHOW TABLES`: displays a list of all tables in the selected database.
- `DESCRIBE`: displays the schema of a table or database.

DML Commands:
- `INSERT INTO`: inserts new data into a table.
- `SELECT`: retrieves data from a table or tables.
- `UPDATE`: modifies existing data in a table.
- `DELETE`: deletes existing data from a table.
- `LOAD DATA`: loads data from an external file or Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) into a Hive table.
- `EXPORT`: exports the data from a Hive table to an external file or HDFS.

Here are some examples of how these commands can be used in Hive:

- Creating a database:
```
CREATE DATABASE my_database;

```
- Creating a table:

```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT,
  name STRING,
  age INT
);
```

- Inserting data into a table:

```
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (1, 'John', 25);
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (2, 'Jane', 30);

```

- Retrieving data from a table:

```
SELECT * FROM my_table;

```

- Updating data in a table:

```
UPDATE my_table SET age = 26 WHERE id = 1;

```

- Deleting data from a table:
```
DELETE FROM my_table WHERE age > 29;

```

These are just a few examples of the many DDL and DML commands available in Hive. By using these commands in Hive queries, users can perform a wide range of data management and analysis tasks.

### 15. Explain about SORT BY, ORDER BY, DISTRIBUTE BY and CLUSTER BY in Hive.
In Hive, SORT BY, ORDER BY, DISTRIBUTE BY, and CLUSTER BY are used to specify how data should be sorted and distributed during query execution. While they may seem similar, each clause serves a different purpose.

1. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. This clause can only be used when the entire data set can fit into memory, which means it should not be used when processing large data sets.

Example:

```
SELECT name, age FROM my_table ORDER BY age DESC;
```

2. SORT BY: The SORT BY clause is similar to the ORDER BY clause, but it only sorts the data within each reducer. This means that the data may not be globally sorted, and multiple reducers may have data with the same key.

Example:

```
SELECT name, age FROM my_table SORT BY age DESC;
```

3. DISTRIBUTE BY: The DISTRIBUTE BY clause is used to determine how to distribute data across reducers. Data with the same key is sent to the same reducer, but the data is not sorted within the reducer. This can be useful for grouping data by a specific column.

Example:

```
SELECT name, age FROM my_table DISTRIBUTE BY age;
```

4. CLUSTER BY: The CLUSTER BY clause is used to sort and distribute data by a specific column. It is similar to the combination of SORT BY and DISTRIBUTE BY. The data is sorted within each reducer and data with the same key is sent to the same reducer.

Example:

```
SELECT name, age FROM my_table CLUSTER BY age;
```

It is important to note that SORT BY, ORDER BY, DISTRIBUTE BY, and CLUSTER BY can have a significant impact on query performance and should be used carefully. Additionally, these clauses can only be used when the query involves a single table or subquery, and not when using JOIN or UNION operations.

### 16. Difference between "Internal Table" and "External Table" and Mention when to choose “Internal Table” and “External Table” in Hive?
In Hive, a table can be either internal or external. The main difference between the two is where the data is stored.

1. Internal Table: An internal table is a table where the data and metadata are stored in the Hive warehouse directory managed by Hive. When a user drops an internal table, both the metadata and data are deleted. Hive assumes full control over the table and its data. 

Example of creating an internal table:

```
CREATE TABLE my_table (id INT, name STRING) STORED AS ORC;
```

2. External Table: An external table is a table where the data is stored outside of the Hive warehouse directory managed by Hive. When a user drops an external table, only the metadata is deleted, not the data. The data is assumed to be managed by external processes, and the data can be accessed by Hive or other tools.

Example of creating an external table:

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_table (id INT, name STRING) STORED AS ORC LOCATION '/path/to/my_table';
```
### 17. When to choose Internal Table and External Table in Hive:

1. Internal Table: If the data is created and managed by Hive, it is best to use an internal table. Internal tables have better performance, better control over the data, and allow for greater ease of use.

2. External Table: If the data is created and managed by external tools, it is best to use an external table. External tables provide greater flexibility in data management, allowing for easier integration with other systems, and enables the reuse of the data with other tools. Additionally, external tables are often used when the data is too large to store in the Hive warehouse, or when it is necessary to access data from multiple locations.

### 18. Where does the data of a Hive table get stored?
The data of a Hive table can be stored in either of the two ways:

1. Internal Table: When a table is created as an internal table, the data and metadata are stored in the Hive warehouse directory managed by Hive. Hive assumes full control over the table and its data.

2. External Table: When a table is created as an external table, the data is stored outside of the Hive warehouse directory managed by Hive. The data is assumed to be managed by external processes, and the data can be accessed by Hive or other tools.

In both cases, the data can be stored in various file formats such as text, ORC, Parquet, Avro, etc. The data can also be stored in various storage systems like HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, etc., depending on the location specified while creating the table.

### 19. Is it possible to change the default location of a managed table?
Yes, it is possible to change the default location of a managed table in Hive. 

When a managed table is created, Hive stores the data in a default location in the Hive warehouse directory. However, it is possible to change the default location of a managed table by altering the table's location property.

For example, to change the default location of a managed table named "my_table" to "/new/location/my_table", you can run the following command:

```
ALTER TABLE my_table SET LOCATION '/new/location/my_table';
```

This will move the data associated with the table to the new location specified, and Hive will use this location as the default storage location for the table from then on.

Note that when you change the location of a managed table, you should ensure that the new location is accessible by Hive and has appropriate permissions. Also, changing the location of a managed table may affect any dependent views, partitions, or indexes associated with the table.

### 20. What is a metastore in Hive? What is the default database provided by Apache Hive for metastore?
In Hive, a metastore is a repository that stores metadata information about Hive tables such as their schema, location, data types, and other information. The metadata is used by Hive to manage the tables and process queries efficiently. 

The metastore in Hive can be configured to use various databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. to store the metadata. By default, Hive provides an embedded Apache Derby database for the metastore, which is suitable for small-scale deployments and testing purposes. 

When using the default Derby database, the metadata is stored in a directory called "metastore_db" in the current working directory. However, for production deployments and large-scale data processing, it is recommended to use an external database with better scalability and performance characteristics for the metastore. 

To configure the metastore database, you can edit the "hive-site.xml" configuration file and specify the appropriate properties such as "javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL" and "javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName".

### 21. Why does Hive not store metadata information in HDFS?
Hive does not store metadata information in HDFS because HDFS is designed primarily for storing large files and is optimized for batch processing rather than small, frequent updates. 

Metadata in Hive is updated frequently when tables are created, altered, or dropped, and also during query processing. Storing metadata in HDFS would require frequent updates to small files, which is not efficient in HDFS. 

Moreover, HDFS does not support concurrent writes to small files, which can lead to contention and performance issues when multiple users or applications try to update the metadata simultaneously. 

To overcome these issues, Hive uses a separate metadata store, called a metastore, to manage the metadata information. The metastore can be configured to use a variety of databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. to store the metadata information in a scalable and efficient manner. This allows Hive to efficiently manage metadata and perform queries while leveraging the benefits of HDFS for storing and processing large data files.

### 22. What is a partition in Hive? And Why do we perform partitioning in Hive?
In Hive, partitioning is a way of dividing a large table into smaller, more manageable parts based on a specific column or set of columns. Each partition of the table is stored as a separate directory in HDFS, and it contains a subset of the table's data that matches the partitioning criteria.

A partition in Hive is defined by a combination of one or more columns, and each distinct combination of partition keys corresponds to a separate partition. For example, if we partition a table on the "date" column, each distinct date value in the table will correspond to a separate partition.

We perform partitioning in Hive for several reasons:

1. Improved query performance: Partitioning allows Hive to restrict the amount of data scanned during query processing, which can improve the performance of queries that filter on partition keys.

2. Better data organization: Partitioning can help to organize the data in a more structured and logical manner, making it easier to manage and analyze.

3. Easier data retrieval: Partitioning can help to make data retrieval more efficient and faster, especially when we need to retrieve a subset of the data based on a specific criteria.

4. Scalability: Partitioning can help to improve scalability by allowing us to split large tables into smaller, more manageable partitions, which can be processed and analyzed independently.

Overall, partitioning is an important feature of Hive that can help to improve query performance and data organization, making it a powerful tool for working with large datasets.

### 23. What is the difference between dynamic partitioning and static partitioning?
Dynamic partitioning and static partitioning are two techniques used in Hive to partition a table based on a specific column or set of columns. The main difference between them is how the partitions are created and managed.

Static Partitioning:
Static partitioning involves manually specifying the partition keys and values for each partition when creating a table. This means that the partition structure is fixed and cannot be changed without altering the table schema. Static partitioning is useful when the data to be partitioned is already known in advance and does not change frequently. 

For example, if we want to partition a sales table by year and month, we can use static partitioning to create a separate partition for each year and month combination:

```
CREATE TABLE sales (
   ...
)
PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/sales';

INSERT INTO sales PARTITION(year=2022, month=1) VALUES (...);
```

Dynamic Partitioning:
Dynamic partitioning allows Hive to automatically determine the partition keys and values based on the data being inserted into the table. This means that the partition structure is flexible and can change dynamically based on the data. Dynamic partitioning is useful when the data is not known in advance or changes frequently.

For example, if we want to partition a sales table by country and product, we can use dynamic partitioning to automatically create partitions for each country and product combination:

```
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;

CREATE TABLE sales (
   ...
)
PARTITIONED BY (country STRING, product STRING)
STORED AS PARQUET
LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/sales';

INSERT INTO sales PARTITION(country, product) VALUES (...);
```

In summary, static partitioning involves manually specifying the partition keys and values, while dynamic partitioning allows Hive to automatically determine the partition keys and values based on the data.

### 24. How do you check if a particular partition exists?
To check if a particular partition exists in Hive, you can use the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command followed by a `LIKE` or `WHERE` clause to filter for the specific partition you are interested in. Here is an example:

```
SHOW PARTITIONS my_table;

-- Returns a list of all partitions in the table

SHOW PARTITIONS my_table WHERE my_partition='2022-05-01';

-- Returns a list of partitions where the partition key 'my_partition' is equal to '2022-05-01'

SHOW PARTITIONS my_table LIKE 'my_partition=2022-05%';

-- Returns a list of partitions where the partition key 'my_partition' starts with '2022-05'
```

Alternatively, you can use the `DESCRIBE FORMATTED` command to view the table properties, including the partition information. Here is an example:

```
DESCRIBE FORMATTED my_table;

-- Returns a detailed description of the table, including the partition information
```

If the partition you are interested in exists, it will be listed in the output of these commands. If it does not exist, there will be no output.

### 25. How can you stop a partition form being queried?
In Hive, you can mark a partition as offline to prevent it from being queried. This can be useful in cases where you want to temporarily exclude a specific partition from queries, such as when you are performing maintenance or updates on that partition. 

To mark a partition as offline, you can use the `ALTER TABLE ... PARTITION ... SET OFFLINE` command. Here is an example:

```
ALTER TABLE my_table PARTITION (my_partition='2022-05-01') SET OFFLINE;
```

This command will mark the partition with the partition key 'my_partition' equal to '2022-05-01' as offline. You can replace these values with the specific partition key and value that you want to mark as offline.

Once a partition is marked as offline, it will not be included in any queries against the table. To include the partition in queries again, you can use the `ALTER TABLE ... PARTITION ... SET ONLINE` command. Here is an example:

```
ALTER TABLE my_table PARTITION (my_partition='2022-05-01') SET ONLINE;
```
This command will mark the partition as online again, allowing it to be included in queries.

### 26. Why do we need buckets? How Hive distributes the rows into buckets?
Buckets in Hive are used to divide a table into smaller, more manageable parts based on a column or set of columns. Bucketing can be used to optimize queries, especially for large tables, by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned to answer a query.

When a table is bucketed, the rows are distributed into a fixed number of buckets based on the value of the bucketing column. Hive uses a hash function on the bucketing column value to determine which bucket a row belongs to. This ensures that rows with the same value for the bucketing column are stored in the same bucket. By default, Hive uses a hash function that generates 32-bit hash values, which are then modded with the number of buckets to determine the bucket number.

Hive allows you to specify the number of buckets to use when creating a table using the `CLUSTERED BY` clause. For example, to create a table with 4 buckets based on the `id` column, you would use the following syntax:

```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS;
```

When inserting data into a bucketed table, you must ensure that the data is sorted by the bucketing column value. This can be done using the `SORT BY` clause when inserting data. For example, to insert data into the `my_table` table created above, you would use the following syntax:

```
INSERT INTO my_table
SELECT id, name, age
FROM my_source_table
SORT BY id;
```

By using buckets in Hive, you can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned. Additionally, buckets can be used to optimize joins between tables, as long as the tables are bucketed on the join key.


### 27. In Hive, how can you enable buckets?
In Hive, you can enable buckets for a table by using the `CLUSTERED BY` clause in the `CREATE TABLE` statement. The `CLUSTERED BY` clause specifies the column or columns on which the table should be bucketed, and the number of buckets to use. For example, to enable buckets for a table called `my_table` with 4 buckets based on the `id` column, you would use the following syntax:

```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS;
```

This creates a table with 4 buckets based on the `id` column.

When inserting data into a bucketed table, you must ensure that the data is sorted by the bucketing column value. This can be done using the `SORT BY` clause when inserting data. For example, to insert data into the `my_table` table created above, you would use the following syntax:

```
INSERT INTO my_table
SELECT id, name, age
FROM my_source_table
SORT BY id;
```

This inserts data into the `my_table` table and sorts the data by the `id` column before inserting it into the table.

Enabling buckets in Hive can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned. Additionally, buckets can be used to optimize joins between tables, as long as the tables are bucketed on the join key.

### 28. How does bucketing help in the faster execution of queries?
Bucketing helps in faster execution of queries in Hive by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned during query processing. When a table is bucketed, the data is partitioned into a fixed number of buckets based on the values in one or more columns. Each bucket is stored as a separate file in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

When a query is executed on a bucketed table, Hive can take advantage of the bucketing to optimize the query execution. If the query specifies a filter on the bucketing column, Hive can scan only the relevant buckets, rather than scanning the entire table. This can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be read from HDFS, which in turn can speed up query execution.

In addition to optimizing queries that filter on the bucketing column, bucketing can also help optimize join operations between two or more tables. If the tables being joined are bucketed on the join key, Hive can perform a map-side join, which can be much faster than a reduce-side join.

Overall, bucketing can be a powerful tool for optimizing query performance in Hive, especially for large datasets. By reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned and processed, bucketing can help Hive execute queries more quickly and efficiently.

### 29. How to optimise Hive Performance? Explain in very detail.
There are several ways to optimize the performance of Hive, including:

1. Partitioning: Partitioning is a technique used to divide large tables into smaller, more manageable parts. This can help improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned for each query. When partitioning a table, it is important to choose the partition key wisely based on the most frequently used filter criteria.

2. Bucketing: Bucketing is another technique that can be used to optimize query performance. Bucketing involves dividing data into a fixed number of buckets based on the values in one or more columns. Bucketing can help improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned for each query.

3. Compression: Hive supports several compression algorithms such as Snappy, LZO, and Gzip that can be used to compress data and improve query performance. Compressed data requires less I/O, so queries can be processed faster.

4. Indexing: Hive supports indexing, which allows users to create indexes on one or more columns of a table. Indexing can help improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned for each query. However, indexing can also increase the size of the table and can slow down insert and update operations.

5. Join optimization: Join operations can be expensive and can significantly slow down query performance. Hive provides several techniques to optimize join operations, including map-side joins, bucketed map-side joins, and sort-merge joins.

6. Hardware optimization: To optimize Hive performance, it is important to have sufficient hardware resources such as memory, CPU, and disk I/O. Increasing the memory available to Hive can significantly improve query performance, as Hive uses memory extensively for query processing.

7. Data storage format: Choosing an appropriate data storage format such as ORC, Parquet, or Avro can also improve query performance. These formats are designed to be highly compressed and are optimized for query processing.

8. Query optimization: Finally, it is important to optimize the queries themselves. This can involve rewriting queries to minimize the amount of data that needs to be processed, using appropriate filters, and avoiding unnecessary joins.

In summary, optimizing Hive performance requires a combination of techniques including partitioning, bucketing, compression, indexing, join optimization, hardware optimization, data storage format, and query optimization. By using these techniques, users can significantly improve the performance of Hive queries and reduce query processing times.

### 30. What is the use of Hcatalog?
HCatalog is a metadata and table management system for Hadoop that enables users to share data between Pig, MapReduce, and Hive. It is a centralized catalog service that provides a schema-based metadata abstraction on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). HCatalog enables sharing of data between different data processing tools without having to worry about the details of how the data is stored in HDFS. 

Some of the use cases of HCatalog are:

1. Metadata management: HCatalog provides a central repository for storing metadata information about data stored in HDFS. This metadata can be used by various data processing tools for performing tasks such as data discovery, lineage analysis, and impact analysis.

2. Schema evolution: HCatalog provides a mechanism for managing changes to data schemas over time. This enables users to easily evolve their data schemas without having to worry about backward compatibility issues.

3. Data sharing: HCatalog enables sharing of data between different data processing tools such as Pig, MapReduce, and Hive. This eliminates the need for data duplication and ensures that all the tools have access to the same data.

4. Security: HCatalog provides a security layer for controlling access to data stored in HDFS. It enables users to specify permissions for data access at a fine-grained level.

Overall, HCatalog provides a unified view of data stored in HDFS and enables seamless integration between different data processing tools.

### 31. Explain about the different types of join in Hive.
In Hive, there are several types of joins that can be used to combine data from multiple tables. The most commonly used types of join in Hive are:

1. Inner Join: Inner join returns only the matching rows from both tables. The join condition is specified using the "ON" keyword.

Example:
```
SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

2. Left Outer Join: Left outer join returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there are no matching rows in the right table, then the result will contain NULL values for the right table columns. The join condition is specified using the "ON" keyword.

Example:
```
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

3. Right Outer Join: Right outer join is similar to the left outer join, but it returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there are no matching rows in the left table, then the result will contain NULL values for the left table columns. The join condition is specified using the "ON" keyword.

Example:
```
SELECT *
FROM table1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

4. Full Outer Join: Full outer join returns all the rows from both tables, along with NULL values for the columns where there is no matching row in the other table. The join condition is specified using the "ON" keyword.

Example:
```
SELECT *
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

5. Left Semi Join: Left semi join returns only the rows from the left table that have a match in the right table. It does not return any columns from the right table. The join condition is specified using the "ON" keyword.

Example:
```
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT SEMI JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

6. Left Anti Join: Left anti join returns only the rows from the left table that do not have a match in the right table. It does not return any columns from the right table. The join condition is specified using the "ON" keyword.

Example:
```
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT ANTI JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

In Hive, joins can be expensive operations, especially when dealing with large tables. It is important to optimize the join queries by using appropriate join types and indexing techniques.

### 32. Is it possible to create a Cartesian join between 2 tables, using Hive?
Yes, it is possible to create a Cartesian join between two tables using Hive. In Hive, the Cartesian product of two tables can be obtained by using the CROSS JOIN keyword in the JOIN clause without any condition. 

For example, suppose we have two tables, table1 and table2, with n and m records respectively, and we want to perform a Cartesian join between them. The query to achieve this in Hive would be:

```
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

This query will return n x m records, which is the Cartesian product of table1 and table2. However, it is important to note that Cartesian joins can be very expensive in terms of resources and can lead to performance issues. Therefore, it is generally recommended to avoid them unless they are absolutely necessary.

### 33. Explain the SMB Join in Hive?
Sort Merge Bucket (SMB) Join in Hive is a type of join algorithm that leverages the benefits of both bucketing and sorting to optimize the performance of join operations. This join algorithm is particularly useful when joining large tables and can significantly improve query performance compared to other join algorithms in Hive.

In SMB Join, both tables being joined are partitioned into buckets on the join key column. Then, each bucket is sorted on the join key column, which allows for efficient merging of the corresponding buckets during the join operation. This ensures that only the relevant buckets are read from disk and processed, reducing the amount of data shuffling and improving overall query performance.

The SMB Join algorithm can be used in Hive when joining two tables that are:

- Bucketed on the same column(s)
- Sorted in the same order on the bucketing column(s)
- Partitioned on the same column(s)

To perform a SMB Join in Hive, the tables being joined should be bucketed and sorted on the join key column(s) using the same number of buckets. Then, the join operation can be performed using the JOIN keyword followed by the ON keyword specifying the join condition and the USING keyword specifying the column(s) to be used for the join.

For example, suppose we have two tables, table1 and table2, that are bucketed on the same column and sorted in the same order on that column. To perform an SMB Join on these tables, we can use the following query:

```
SELECT *
FROM table1
JOIN table2
ON table1.join_col = table2.join_col
USING (join_col)
```

This query will perform a Sort Merge Bucket Join on the tables using the join column join_col. The resulting joined table will be partitioned and sorted on the join column(s), which can further optimize query performance for subsequent queries on the same data.

### 34. What is the difference between order by and sort by which one we should use?
In Hive, both ORDER BY and SORT BY are used to sort the data in a table, but they work differently.

ORDER BY: sorts the entire dataset by the specified column(s) in ascending (default) or descending order. The results are returned as a single file. This is useful when you need to retrieve the entire dataset in a sorted order, but it can be slow and resource-intensive for large datasets.

SORT BY: sorts the data within each reducer by the specified column(s). The results are not guaranteed to be in sorted order across the entire dataset, but they can be useful for small to medium-sized datasets when you only need to retrieve a portion of the data. It is faster than ORDER BY, but it can result in unsorted data when multiple reducers are used.

Therefore, which one to use depends on the specific use case and the size of the data. If you need the entire dataset in sorted order, then ORDER BY is the better choice. If you only need a portion of the data and don't mind if it's not sorted across the entire dataset, then SORT BY can be a better option.

### 35. What is the usefulness of the DISTRIBUTED BY clause in Hive?
The `DISTRIBUTED BY` clause in Hive is used to specify the columns by which data is to be partitioned and distributed across different nodes in a Hadoop cluster. When a table is created or altered with a `DISTRIBUTED BY` clause, Hive uses the values in the specified column(s) to determine which node to store each row on, based on the data distribution algorithm used by the underlying Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

The `DISTRIBUTED BY` clause is useful for optimizing query performance by ensuring that related data is stored together on the same node, reducing the amount of data shuffling required during query processing. By default, Hive distributes data evenly across all nodes in the cluster, which may not be optimal for all use cases.

For example, if a table contains sales data for different regions, it might be useful to distribute the data by region so that all sales data for a given region is stored together on the same node. This can improve query performance when filtering or aggregating data by region, as only the relevant nodes need to be queried and the results can be combined locally.

### 36. How does data transfer happen from HDFS to Hive?
In Hive, the data transfer from HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to Hive tables happens in two ways:

1. **Internal Tables:** When we create an internal table in Hive, the data is stored in the HDFS, but the metadata and schema information of the table is managed by the Hive. When the user queries an internal table, Hive uses its metadata to locate the data in HDFS and reads it.

2. **External Tables:** When we create an external table in Hive, the data is not moved to Hive warehouse directory. Instead, the metadata and schema information of the table is managed by the Hive. The data remains in the external location, which can be a local file system, HDFS, or any other storage system. When the user queries an external table, Hive uses its metadata to locate the data in the external location and reads it.

In both the cases, Hive uses a SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer) to read the data in HDFS, which converts the data into a row format that Hive can understand. The SerDe also converts the data from the row format back to its original format when it is written back to HDFS. This way, data transfer between HDFS and Hive is seamless and efficient.

### 37. Wherever (Different Directory) I run the hive query, it creates a new metastore_db, please explain the reason for it?
The metastore_db is created by Hive to store metadata related to tables, databases, columns, and partitions. It is used to manage the schema and structure of the data stored in Hive. The metastore_db is created by default in the directory where the Hive service is started, and it is used by all Hive queries that are executed on that service. 

If you are running Hive queries from different directories, then Hive will create a new metastore_db in each of those directories. This happens because Hive uses a configuration file (hive-site.xml) to determine the location of the metastore_db, and the configuration file is typically located in the same directory as the Hive service. When you run Hive from a different directory, it will look for the configuration file in that directory and create a new metastore_db in that directory.

To avoid creating multiple metastore_dbs, you can either run Hive queries from the same directory where the Hive service is started or update the hive-site.xml configuration file to point to a common location for the metastore_db.

### 38. What will happen in case you have not issued the command: ‘SET hive.enforce.bucketing=true;’ before bucketing a table in Hive?
When bucketing a table in Hive without setting the configuration property `hive.enforce.bucketing=true`, Hive will not perform bucketing enforcement and will write data to the specified location in the file system without checking if the data is actually bucketed or not. This can lead to incorrect query results or even failure of queries that expect bucketing to be enforced. Therefore, it is recommended to always set the configuration property `hive.enforce.bucketing=true` before bucketing a table in Hive.

### 39. Can a table be renamed in Hive?
Yes, a table can be renamed in Hive using the RENAME TABLE command. The syntax for renaming a table in Hive is as follows:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;
```

Here, `table_name` is the name of the existing table that needs to be renamed, and `new_table_name` is the new name that the table should be renamed to. The table's metadata is updated accordingly, but the underlying data remains in the same location on HDFS.

### 40. Write a query to insert a new column(new_col INT) into a hive table at a position before an existing column (x_col)
To add a new column before an existing column in a Hive table, we can use the ALTER TABLE statement with the CHANGE COLUMN clause. Here's an example query to insert a new column `new_col` before an existing column `x_col`:

```
ALTER TABLE my_table CHANGE COLUMN x_col x_col_old INT FIRST;
ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMNS (new_col INT) AFTER some_existing_column;
ALTER TABLE my_table CHANGE COLUMN x_col_old x_col INT AFTER new_col;
```

In this query, we first change the name of the existing column `x_col` to `x_col_old` and make it an INT column. We use the `FIRST` keyword to move this column to the beginning of the column list.

Next, we add the new column `new_col` using the `ADD COLUMNS` clause and specify the position of the new column using the `AFTER` keyword. In this example, we've placed the new column after some existing column.

Finally, we change the name of the `x_col_old` column back to `x_col` and place it after the `new_col` column using the `AFTER` keyword. This effectively inserts the new column `new_col` before the existing column `x_col`.

### 41. What is serde operation in HIVE?
In Hive, SerDe stands for Serializer/Deserializer. It is a crucial component of Hive that enables it to read and write data in various formats. SerDe is responsible for serializing the data while writing to HDFS and deserializing it while reading from HDFS. 

Hive supports a wide range of data formats such as CSV, TSV, JSON, ORC, Parquet, etc. Each data format requires a different SerDe to read and write data to HDFS. For instance, if we have data in a CSV format, we need to specify the CSV SerDe while creating the table in Hive. Similarly, if we have data in a JSON format, we need to specify the JSON SerDe.

In summary, SerDe is a critical component in Hive that provides the ability to read and write data in various formats.

### 42. Explain how Hive Deserializes and serialises the data?
In Hive, serde stands for "Serializer/Deserializer." Hive uses serde operations to serialize the input data into a binary format for storage in HDFS and to deserialize the binary data during query execution. The serde operations provide a way to store and read data in a particular format, such as CSV, JSON, Avro, or ORC.

When data is loaded into Hive, serde operations are used to convert the input data into a Hive internal data format, which is then written to HDFS. During query execution, serde operations are used to read the data from HDFS and convert it back to its original format. Serde operations are also used to transform the data during intermediate stages of query execution, such as during sorting or grouping.

Hive provides a set of built-in serdes for common data formats, such as CSV, JSON, and Avro. Additionally, Hive allows users to write custom serdes to handle non-standard data formats. Custom serdes can be written in Java or any other language that can run on the JVM.

Overall, serde operations play a crucial role in Hive's ability to handle a wide range of data formats and to store and retrieve data efficiently from HDFS.

### 43. Write the name of the built-in serde in hive.
The built-in serde in Hive is called "LazySimpleSerDe".

### 44. What is the need of custom Serde?
Hive provides built-in SerDes for commonly used data formats such as CSV, JSON, Avro, and ORC. However, in some cases, these built-in SerDes may not be sufficient to handle custom data formats or data that requires special handling. In such cases, we need to develop custom SerDes.

Custom SerDes can be used to handle data formats that are not supported by the built-in SerDes, or to provide more efficient and optimized ways to handle data formats that are already supported. Custom SerDes are also useful when data requires special handling, such as data that needs to be processed or transformed in a specific way before being loaded into Hive.

By developing custom SerDes, we can improve the performance of Hive queries and optimize the storage and retrieval of data from Hive tables.

### 45. Can you write the name of a complex data type(collection data types) in Hive?
Yes, the name of complex data types (collection data types) in Hive are as follows:

1. ARRAY: An ordered list of elements of the same data type.
2. MAP: A collection of key-value pairs where each key maps to a single value.
3. STRUCT: A collection of named fields, each with a data type.

### 46. Can hive queries be executed from script files? How?
Yes, hive queries can be executed from script files. 

To execute hive queries from script files, we can create a script file with a `.hql` extension and write the hive queries in it. Then, we can run the script file using the `hive` command with the `-f` option followed by the path of the script file.

Example:

Let's say we have a script file named `my_script.hql` with the following content:

```
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

To execute this script file, we can run the following command:

```
hive -f /path/to/my_script.hql
```

This will run the hive query in `my_script.hql` and return the results.

### 47. What are the default record and field delimiter used for hive text files?
The default record delimiter used for Hive text files is the newline character (`\n`), and the default field delimiter is the tab character (`\t`).

### 48. How do you list all databases in Hive whose name starts with s?
To list all the databases in Hive whose name starts with 's', you can use the following command:

```
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 's*';
```

This command will return a list of all databases whose name starts with 's'. The `LIKE` keyword is used to search for database names that match the pattern 's*', where '*' represents any number of characters.

### 49. What is the difference between LIKE and RLIKE operators in Hive?
In Hive, LIKE and RLIKE are string pattern matching operators used in WHERE clauses of SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

LIKE operator matches a pattern using wildcard characters, where the percent symbol (%) matches any string of any length, and the underscore symbol (_) matches any single character. For example, the following query returns all the names that start with 'a':

```
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE name LIKE 'a%';
```

RLIKE operator, on the other hand, matches a pattern using regular expressions. It returns true if a string matches the regular expression, otherwise, false. For example, the following query returns all the names that contain the pattern 'a.*c':

```
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE name RLIKE 'a.*c';
```

In short, LIKE is used for simple string pattern matching, whereas RLIKE is used for more complex pattern matching using regular expressions.

### 50. How to change the column data type in Hive?
To change the column data type in Hive, you can use the `ALTER TABLE` command with the `CHANGE` clause. Here is the syntax for changing the column data type:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE column_name column_name new_data_type;
```

Here, `table_name` is the name of the table whose column data type needs to be changed, `column_name` is the name of the column whose data type needs to be changed, and `new_data_type` is the new data type for the column.

For example, let's say you have a table named `employees` with a column named `salary` that has a data type of `INT`. If you want to change the data type of the `salary` column to `DOUBLE`, you can use the following command:

```
ALTER TABLE employees CHANGE salary salary DOUBLE;
```

This command will change the data type of the `salary` column from `INT` to `DOUBLE`.

### 51. How will you convert the string ’51.2’ to a float value in the particular column?
To convert the string '51.2' to a float value in a particular column in Hive, you can use the `CAST` function. Here is an example query:

```
SELECT CAST('51.2' AS FLOAT) AS my_float_value FROM my_table;
```

In the above query, the `CAST` function is used to convert the string value '51.2' to a float value. The `AS` keyword is used to assign a name to the converted value, which is then returned as the result of the query. Replace `my_table` with the name of your table and `my_float_value` with the desired name of your float column.


### 52. What will be the result when you cast ‘abc’ (string) as INT? 

When you try to cast a non-numeric string, such as 'abc', as an INT in Hive, it will result in a NULL value. This is because Hive cannot convert a non-numeric string into an integer.


### 53. What does the following query do? 
a. INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE employees 
b. PARTITION (country, state) 
c. SELECT ..., se.cnty, se.st 
d. FROM staged_employees se; 

a. The query performs an overwrite operation to load data into the "employees" table with partitioning on two columns "country" and "state". The data is selected from a temporary/staging table named "staged_employees" and some columns are explicitly mentioned with an alias. The "cnty" and "st" columns are used for partitioning.
b. The given query is an example of an INSERT OVERWRITE operation in Hive, which inserts data from the "staged_employees" table into the "employees" table, while partitioning the data by the "country" and "state" columns.
More specifically, the "PARTITION (country, state)" clause specifies that the data should be partitioned based on the values in the "country" and "state" columns. This means that separate files will be created in HDFS for each combination of "country" and "state" values.
The "SELECT" statement following the "PARTITION" clause is used to specify which columns from the "staged_employees" table should be inserted into the "employees" table, along with additional computed or derived columns as required. The "se.cnty" and "se.st" columns in the "SELECT" statement are aliases for the "country" and "state" columns in the "staged_employees" table, respectively, and are used to ensure that the partitioning is done correctly.
c. The following query is not complete, as it lacks the `FROM` clause. However, based on the provided snippet `..., se.cnty, se.st`, it seems to be selecting some columns from a table or a subquery named `se`, and also including two additional columns `cnty` and `st`. These two columns could be aliases for columns in the `se` table or subquery, or they could be calculated columns using functions or expressions.
D. The query "FROM staged_employees se;" selects all columns from the "staged_employees" table, and assigns an alias "se" to the table name. This query is used as a subquery or as a source table in other queries, such as insert into a table or join with another table.


### 54. Write a query where you can overwrite data in a new table from the existing table. 

To overwrite data in a new table from an existing table in Hive, you can use the `INSERT OVERWRITE` command with the `SELECT` statement to specify the data to be copied. Here is an example query:

```
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE new_table
SELECT * FROM existing_table;
```

In this example, the `INSERT OVERWRITE` command will overwrite the data in the `new_table` table with the data from the `existing_table` table. The `SELECT *` statement selects all columns from the `existing_table` table, which will be inserted into the `new_table` table.


### 55. What is the maximum size of a string data type supported by Hive? Explain how Hive supports binary formats. 

In Hive, the maximum size of a string data type is 2 GB.

Hive supports binary formats by using custom SerDe (Serializer-Deserializer) classes. These SerDe classes are used to serialize and deserialize data in different formats such as Avro, ORC, Parquet, etc. When data is loaded into Hive, the SerDe class is used to convert the data from its binary format to a format that Hive can understand. Similarly, when data is written out from Hive, the SerDe class is used to convert the data from Hive's format to the binary format. 

For example, when data is stored in ORC format, the ORC SerDe class is used to serialize and deserialize the data. The ORC format stores data in a columnar format, which allows for efficient compression and faster query performance. When querying data in ORC format, Hive can skip over data that is not needed for the query, which further improves performance. 

In summary, Hive's support for binary formats allows for efficient storage and processing of large amounts of data, making it a powerful tool for data warehousing and analytics.


### 56. What File Formats and Applications Does Hive Support? 

Hive supports various file formats and applications, some of which are listed below:

1. Text Files: Hive supports text files such as CSV, TSV, and plain text files.

2. Sequence Files: Hive can read and write to Hadoop Sequence files.

3. RCFile: It is a columnar file format for storing data in a compressed format. Hive provides support for the RCFile format.

4. ORC File: It is an Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) file format. ORC files are highly compressed and can be read faster than other file formats. Hive provides support for the ORC file format.

5. Parquet: It is a columnar storage file format that is highly compressed and is designed to be efficient for large-scale data processing. Hive provides support for the Parquet file format.

6. Avro: It is a data serialization system that is used for exchange of data between systems. Hive provides support for the Avro file format.

7. JSON: Hive can read and write data in JSON format.

Hive also supports various applications such as Sqoop, Flume, Pig, and Spark, which can be used for data import and export from and to external systems.


### 57. How do ORC format tables help Hive to enhance its performance? 

ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) format tables in Hive can significantly enhance its performance by reducing the I/O operations needed to access and process data. ORC format tables store data in a highly compressed columnar format, which makes it possible to read and process only the required columns instead of scanning the entire table. This reduces the amount of I/O operations required to read the data, leading to faster query performance. 

Moreover, ORC format tables also support predicate pushdown, which means that filtering operations can be pushed down to the storage layer, reducing the amount of data that needs to be read and processed by Hive. This further improves query performance and reduces the resource requirements of the cluster. 

Overall, ORC format tables are highly efficient for analytical workloads that involve large volumes of data, and can significantly enhance the performance of Hive.


### 58. How can Hive avoid mapreduce while processing the query? 

Hive can avoid using MapReduce while processing the query through the use of Tez execution engine or LLAP (Live Long and Process). These are alternatives to the traditional MapReduce processing framework. 

Tez is an application framework that allows for high-performance and efficient data processing on top of Hadoop. It works by executing the data processing tasks in a single Tez job instead of multiple MapReduce jobs, thus reducing the overhead of launching multiple jobs. This helps in faster processing of the query and is more efficient as compared to the traditional MapReduce framework.

LLAP is another option for Hive to avoid using MapReduce. It runs a long-lived daemons which are maintained across multiple Hive queries and sessions. These daemons have the ability to cache and share data across queries which helps in faster query processing. Additionally, it provides in-memory caching which further improves performance.

By using Tez or LLAP, Hive can execute queries more efficiently without using MapReduce, resulting in better performance and faster query processing times.


### 59. What is view and indexing in hive? 

In Hive, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SQL query. It is not a physical table but a logical table. When a query is executed against a view, it actually runs the underlying SQL query that is used to create the view. Views provide an abstraction layer between the users and the underlying physical tables, making it easier for users to query data without knowing the details of the underlying data.

Indexing in Hive refers to creating a data structure to allow faster retrieval of data from a table. In Hive, two types of indexing are supported: Bitmap index and Bloom filter index. Bitmap index is an index on a single column that can speed up queries that filter on that column. Bloom filter index is an index that can speed up queries that use the JOIN or GROUP BY operations. Hive uses the Hadoop Distributed Cache to store the index data.


### 60. Can the name of a view be the same as the name of a hive table? 

Yes, the name of a view can be the same as the name of a Hive table, as they are stored in different metadata locations. However, it is not recommended to have the same name for a view and a table, as it may cause confusion and make it difficult to manage the objects. It is better to have distinct and descriptive names for views and tables.

### 61. What types of costs are associated in creating indexes on hive tables? 

There are two types of costs associated with creating indexes on Hive tables: 
1. Time cost: Creating an index requires additional time during table creation, and the time required to update the index during insert, update, or delete operations. 
2. Storage cost: Indexes require additional storage space, which can become significant when the table is large or when there are multiple indexes on the same table.

### 62. Give the command to see the indexes on a table. 

The command to see the indexes on a table in Hive is:

```
SHOW INDEXES ON table_name;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table for which you want to see the indexes. This command will display a list of indexes associated with the table.


### 63. Explain the process to access subdirectories recursively in Hive queries. 

In Hive, to access subdirectories recursively, we can use the `INPUT__FILE__NAME` virtual column. This column contains the input file name for each row of the table, including its full path.

We can use this column to filter and select files recursively using the `LIKE` operator and wildcard characters `%` and `_`. For example, to select all the files in a directory and its subdirectories, we can use the following command:

```
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE input__file__name LIKE '/mydir/%';
```

This command will select all the rows from the `mytable` table where the input file name starts with `/mydir/` and any character(s) after it.

We can also use the `SUBSTR` function to extract the directory path from the `INPUT__FILE__NAME` column. For example, to group the rows by directory path, we can use the following command:

```
SELECT SUBSTR(input__file__name, 1, INSTR(input__file__name, '/', -1)) as directory, COUNT(*) as count
FROM mytable
GROUP BY directory;
```
This command will extract the directory path from the `INPUT__FILE__NAME` column using the `SUBSTR` and `INSTR` functions and group the rows by directory path.


### 64. If you run a select * query in Hive, why doesn't it run MapReduce? 

When a SELECT * query is executed in Hive, it doesn't run a MapReduce job if the table is stored in a supported file format (such as ORC or Parquet) and has its metadata stored in Hive's metastore. This is because the file format contains enough information about the data to allow Hive to read it directly without the need for MapReduce. This process is known as "vectorization" or "vectorized query execution".

In vectorization, Hive reads the data in batches and processes it using specialized code paths that are optimized for performance. This approach is much faster than running a MapReduce job because it avoids the overhead of launching and managing a Hadoop job.

However, if the table is stored in a file format that is not supported by Hive or if the metadata is not available in the metastore, then Hive will need to run a MapReduce job to process the data. In this case, the query will take longer to execute than if the table were stored in a supported file format and had its metadata in the metastore.


### 65. What are the uses of Hive Explode? 

Hive `explode()` is a built-in function that is used to transform an array or map data type column into multiple rows, effectively creating a "flattened" table. The exploded table will have one row for each element in the array or map, along with the corresponding value of the exploded column and the remaining columns of the original table.

The `explode()` function is useful when working with nested data structures, such as JSON data, that need to be flattened in order to be queried or analyzed more easily. It is also useful when performing aggregations on the elements of an array or map.

For example, suppose we have a table `orders` with the following schema:

```
order_id INT,
customer_id INT,
items ARRAY<STRING>
```

We can use the `explode()` function to create a flattened table of all orders and their corresponding items as follows:

```
SELECT order_id, customer_id, item
FROM orders
LATERAL VIEW explode(items) exploded_table AS item;
```

This will produce a table with the following schema:

```
order_id INT,
customer_id INT,
item STRING
```

Where each row corresponds to an item in the original array column.


### 66. What is the available mechanism for connecting applications when we run Hive as a server? 

When Hive is running as a server, the available mechanism for connecting applications is through JDBC/ODBC drivers. Hive provides JDBC/ODBC drivers that can be used by applications to connect to Hive and run queries. The JDBC/ODBC drivers translate the SQL queries issued by applications to HiveQL and pass them on to Hive server for execution. Applications can use the JDBC/ODBC drivers to connect to Hive server remotely and execute queries.


### 67. Can the default location of a managed table be changed in Hive? 

Yes, the default location of a managed table can be changed in Hive by setting the `hive.metastore.warehouse.dir` property to a new directory path. This can be done by modifying the `hive-site.xml` file or using the `SET` command in Hive. 

For example, to change the default location of the managed table to `/new/warehouse/directory`, you can use the following command:

```
SET hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=/new/warehouse/directory;
``` 

This will change the default location of all new managed tables to the new directory. However, existing managed tables will still use their old location. To move the existing tables to the new location, you can either use the `ALTER TABLE` command or move the table files manually.


### 68. What is the Hive ObjectInspector function? 

In Hive, ObjectInspector is a class used for serializing and deserializing data between Hive and other applications. The ObjectInspector function is used to inspect the internal structure of data stored in Hive tables and convert it to the corresponding Java objects. It provides methods to get the field names and types, as well as to extract the values from the data. 

ObjectInspector is used extensively in Hive for processing and transforming data, including the execution of UDFs (User-Defined Functions). UDFs use ObjectInspector to convert the data types of input and output parameters. ObjectInspector also supports complex data types such as arrays, maps, and structs. 

Overall, ObjectInspector plays a crucial role in Hive by enabling efficient data processing and integration with external applications.


### 69. What is UDF in Hive? 

UDF stands for User-Defined Function in Hive. It is a way to extend the functionality of Hive by allowing users to write their own functions to process data in a customized way. UDFs can be written in different languages such as Java, Python, and Scala, and can take one or more arguments. 

Once a UDF is created, it can be used in Hive queries like any other built-in function. UDFs can be particularly useful when dealing with complex data types or performing custom operations on data that cannot be achieved with built-in functions. 

Hive also provides several built-in UDFs, such as mathematical functions, string manipulation functions, date and time functions, and more. Users can also create their own UDFs and add them to their Hive environment for use in their queries.


### 70. Write a query to extract data from hdfs to hive. 

To extract data from HDFS to Hive, you can use the following query:

```
LOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs://<hdfs_path_to_input_file>' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE <hive_table_name>;
```

Here, `<hdfs_path_to_input_file>` is the path of the input file in HDFS, and `<hive_table_name>` is the name of the Hive table where you want to load the data.

Note that the `LOAD DATA` statement is used to load data from an external file into a Hive table. The data is copied into the table's data directory, which is located in HDFS by default. The `OVERWRITE` keyword is used to overwrite any existing data in the table.


### 71. What is TextInputFormat and SequenceFileInputFormat in hive. 

In Hive, TextInputFormat and SequenceFileInputFormat are two input formats used to read data from files in HDFS.

TextInputFormat is the default input format in Hive for reading plain text files. It splits the input files into logical blocks and assigns each block to a mapper for processing. Each record in the file is considered as a line, and the key is the byte offset of the record from the beginning of the file.

SequenceFileInputFormat is used to read data stored in SequenceFiles. SequenceFiles are binary files that store key-value pairs in a compressed format. SequenceFileInputFormat reads the data from the SequenceFile, deserializes the keys and values, and sends them to the mapper for processing.

Both TextInputFormat and SequenceFileInputFormat are configurable in Hive, and you can specify them while creating tables or loading data into tables.


### 72. How can you prevent a large job from running for a long time in a hive? 

There are several ways to prevent a large job from running for a long time in Hive:

1. Enable hive.execution.engine=tez: Tez is a more efficient execution engine compared to MapReduce, which is the default execution engine. Tez can help in speeding up the execution of Hive queries.

2. Set hive.auto.convert.join=true: This enables automatic map-side join conversion. This means that smaller tables can be replicated and joined with larger tables, which can improve query performance.

3. Use partitioning: Partitioning helps in reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed. Queries can be executed on a smaller subset of data if partitioning is done correctly.

4. Use bucketing: Bucketing is similar to partitioning, but the difference is that the data is divided into fixed-size buckets based on the values of a particular column. Bucketing can also help in reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.

5. Use LIMIT clause: The LIMIT clause can be used to limit the number of rows returned by a query. This can help in preventing long-running queries from consuming too much resources.

6. Tune the cluster configuration: The cluster configuration can be tuned to optimize the performance of Hive. This includes setting the number of map and reduce slots, setting the memory allocation for map and reduce tasks, and adjusting the size of the cluster to match the workload.


### 73. When do we use explode in Hive? 

We use the `explode()` function in Hive when we have a column with array values, and we want to transform the data such that each element of the array becomes a separate row. The `explode()` function takes an array column as input and outputs a new row for each element in the array.

For example, if we have a table `mytable` with a column `myarray` containing array values:

```
+-------------------+
|      myarray      |
+-------------------+
| [1, 2, 3]         |
| [4, 5]            |
+-------------------+
```

We can use the `explode()` function to transform the data into separate rows for each element of the array:

```
SELECT explode(myarray) AS myvalue FROM mytable;
```

The result will be:

```
+-------------------+
|      myvalue      |
+-------------------+
| 1                 |
| 2                 |
| 3                 |
| 4                 |
| 5                 |
+-------------------+
```

Note that `explode()` can also be used with nested arrays to flatten them into separate rows.


### 74. Can Hive process any type of data formats? Why? Explain in very detail 

Hive is a data warehousing tool that is primarily used for processing and analyzing large amounts of structured and semi-structured data. It is based on Apache Hadoop, which is a distributed data processing framework. Hive provides a SQL-like interface to Hadoop, which allows users to write SQL-like queries to process data stored in Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS).

Hive can process various types of data formats, including text files, CSV files, JSON files, Parquet files, and ORC files. However, Hive is primarily designed to work with structured data formats such as CSV, TSV, and ORC. This is because Hive is optimized for processing structured data, and it provides a lot of features and functionality that are specific to structured data.

Hive can also process semi-structured data formats such as JSON and Avro. However, processing these formats can be slower compared to structured data formats because Hive needs to parse the data to determine the schema and convert it into a structured format.

To process unstructured data formats such as images, audio, and video files, Hive is not a suitable tool. Unstructured data requires specialized tools and techniques, such as deep learning models and computer vision algorithms, to extract meaning and insights from it.

In summary, Hive is a versatile data warehousing tool that can process various types of data formats. However, it is optimized for processing structured and semi-structured data formats, and it may not be suitable for processing unstructured data formats.


### 75. Whenever we run a Hive query, a new metastore_db is created. Why? 

The metastore_db is a database created by Hive to store metadata information related to tables, partitions, columns, and other objects in Hive. Whenever a Hive query is executed, the Hive client interacts with the metastore to fetch metadata information and execute the query.

When Hive is installed for the first time, the metastore_db is created in the configured directory. It stores the metadata for all the databases and tables created in Hive. However, whenever a Hive query is executed, a new metastore connection is established to fetch the metadata information. This is done to ensure that the latest metadata information is fetched, and the query execution is not impacted by any stale metadata information. Once the query execution is completed, the metastore connection is closed, and the temporary database is dropped.

This approach ensures that the query execution is not impacted by any changes in metadata information made by other clients or processes running on the same metastore_db. It also helps in isolating the query execution from other queries running concurrently on the same metastore_db, ensuring that each query gets its own set of metadata information.

### 76. Can we change the data type of a column in a hive table? Write a complete query. 

Yes, we can change the data type of a column in a Hive table. Here is a sample query to do so:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE column_name column_name_new_datatype;
```

For example, suppose we have a table named `employees` with a column `age` of datatype `INT`, and we want to change it to `BIGINT`. The query to do so would be:

```
ALTER TABLE employees CHANGE age age BIGINT;
``` 

This query will change the datatype of the `age` column in the `employees` table from `INT` to `BIGINT`.


### 77. While loading data into a hive table using the LOAD DATA clause, how do you specify it is a hdfs file and not a local file ? 

When loading data into a Hive table using the LOAD DATA clause, you can specify that the file is in HDFS by using the HDFS file path instead of the local file path. Here's an example:

```
LOAD DATA INPATH '/path/to/hdfs/file' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE my_table;
```

In this example, `/path/to/hdfs/file` is the HDFS file path where the data file is stored. The `INPATH` keyword is used to specify the input path of the file, and the `OVERWRITE` keyword is used to overwrite any existing data in the table.

You can also use a fully qualified HDFS URI to specify the location of the file, like this:

```
LOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs://namenode:port/path/to/hdfs/file' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE my_table;
```

In this example, `namenode:port` is the hostname and port number of the HDFS namenode, and `/path/to/hdfs/file` is the path to the data file in HDFS.


### 78. What is the precedence order in Hive configuration? 

The precedence order in Hive configuration is as follows:

1. Hive command line options: Any options set on the command line with the -hiveconf flag take the highest precedence.

2. Hadoop configuration files: Hive uses Hadoop for underlying file system and cluster management, so the Hadoop configuration files (core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, etc.) are also used to configure Hive.

3. Hive configuration files: Hive also has its own configuration files, hive-site.xml, which are used to configure Hive-specific properties.

4. Environment variables: Hive also supports setting configuration properties via environment variables.

5. System properties: Finally, Hive will also consider Java system properties when configuring itself.


### 79. Which interface is used for accessing the Hive metastore? 

The Thrift API is used for accessing the Hive metastore. Thrift is a software framework that allows applications written in different programming languages to communicate with each other. In Hive, Thrift is used to define a set of APIs for accessing the metastore, and these APIs can be called from applications written in any language that supports Thrift. The Thrift API provides a way for external applications to interact with the metastore, which is where Hive stores its metadata, such as table and partition definitions, column and data types, and other schema-related information.


### 80. Is it possible to compress json in the Hive external table ? 

Yes, it is possible to compress JSON data in Hive external tables using supported compression codecs like gzip, snappy, etc. 

To compress JSON data in Hive external table, you can specify the compression codec while creating the table as shown below:

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE json_data (
   id INT,
   name STRING
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe'
STORED AS TEXTFILE
LOCATION '/user/hive/json'
TBLPROPERTIES ('serialization.null.format'='', 'compression.codec'='org.apache.hadoop.io.compress.GzipCodec');
```

In the above example, the table is created with the `GzipCodec` compression codec, which compresses the JSON data stored in the `/user/hive/json` location.


### 81. What is the difference between local and remote metastores? 


A local metastore is a Hive metastore that runs on the same node as the Hive server, while a remote metastore runs on a different node or on a different machine altogether. The choice of using a local or remote metastore depends on the size and complexity of the Hive deployment. 

In a small deployment with only one or a few Hive servers, a local metastore is a good option since it eliminates the network overhead associated with a remote metastore. However, in a large deployment with many Hive servers, a remote metastore is better since it allows for centralized management of metadata and ensures consistency across all Hive instances.


### 82. What is the purpose of archiving tables in Hive? 

Archiving tables in Hive involves moving the data of a table or partition to a different location in HDFS and then compressing it to save space. The purpose of archiving tables is to reduce the storage space consumed by infrequently accessed data. By archiving the data, it can be stored in a compressed format, which takes up less space and can be retrieved quickly when required. Archiving tables also helps in reducing the number of files on the HDFS file system, making it easier to manage and optimize the overall performance. Additionally, archiving tables allows users to restore the data if needed in the future. Overall, archiving tables in Hive is a useful technique to optimize the storage and performance of large datasets.


### 83. What is DBPROPERTY in Hive? 

DBPROPERTY is a function in Hive that is used to get metadata properties for the current database or a specific table. It returns the value of the specified property for the specified object in the current or specified database.

The syntax of the DBPROPERTY function is as follows:

```
DBPROPERTY(database_name, property_name)
```

Here, `database_name` is the name of the database for which we want to retrieve the property, and `property_name` is the name of the property that we want to retrieve.

For example, if we want to retrieve the description of a table named `my_table` in the database `my_database`, we can use the following query:

```
SELECT DBPROPERTY('my_database', 'comment') AS table_description FROM my_table;
```

This query will return the value of the `comment` property for the table `my_table` in the database `my_database`. If the `comment` property is not set for the table, the query will return a `NULL` value.


### 84. Differentiate between local mode and MapReduce mode in Hive. 

In Hive, the two modes available to run queries are local mode and MapReduce mode.

1. Local mode: In local mode, data is processed on a single machine, and no Hadoop cluster is required. In this mode, Hive operates as a standalone tool. This mode is used for small datasets that can be processed on a single machine.

2. MapReduce mode: In MapReduce mode, Hive uses Hadoop to execute the query on a cluster of machines. This mode is used for large datasets that require distributed processing. The data is split into smaller chunks and processed in parallel on different nodes of the cluster, which reduces the processing time.

The key differences between local mode and MapReduce mode are:

- Performance: In local mode, the performance is limited by the resources of a single machine, while in MapReduce mode, the performance can be scaled up by adding more machines to the cluster.

- Scalability: Local mode is not scalable as it is limited to the resources of a single machine. On the other hand, MapReduce mode is highly scalable, as it can process large datasets by using multiple machines in the cluster.

- Data processing: In local mode, data is processed on a single machine, while in MapReduce mode, data is processed in parallel on multiple machines in the cluster.

- Setup: In local mode, no Hadoop cluster is required, and Hive operates as a standalone tool. In contrast, MapReduce mode requires a Hadoop cluster to be set up and configured properly.

- Complexity: Local mode is simple and easy to set up, while MapReduce mode requires expertise in Hadoop and cluster management.
